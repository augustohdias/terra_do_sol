[NAME:Terra do Sol, Chapter 0 - Inca Cosmogony]
[DESCRIPTION:"Terra do Sol" aims to bring the rich cultures of pre-Columbian South America into the world of Dwarf Fortress. This mod is a respectful tribute, focusing on authentic representation through new civilizations, religions and creatures. No Vanilla RAW files were armed in the making of this mod.

In the dawn of the time, when darkness reigned and only the primal waters of Mama Cocha, the Mother Sea, stirred, the great creator Viracocha emerged from a sacred lake: Titicaca. His power was vast and uncontested, and it was he who first brought order to the chaos. With a powerful command, Viracocha sculpted the firmament and gave birth to the celestial deities who would govern the world: he launched Inti, the resplendent sun god, into the sky to bring light and warmth, and Mama Killa, the serene moon goddess, to illuminate the night and mark time with her silver cycles.

Having illuminated the cosmos and pacified the waters of Mama Cocha, Viracocha turned his attention to the creation of life on the world. He molded life in his second attempt from the earth and stones, instructing the habitants of the world on agriculture, weaving, and the worship of Inti and Mama Killa. After establishing the foundations of civilization and designating the peoples to inhabit the valleys and mountains, Viracocha walked across the waters of Mama Cocha toward the west, disappearing on the horizon. He left the world under the watchful eye of his divine children, ensuring that the brilliance of Inti and the soft light of Mama Killa would guide the empire that would rise in his honor.

For ages, balance reigned, but the world forgot the ancient lessons. Greed and conflicts stained the sacred mountains. Suddenly, the harmony was broken. The temples of Inti dimmed; the gentle light of Mama Killa fractured with a chilling, blood-red hue. The very waters of Mama Cocha churned with unprecedented violence, and a veil of chaos and disease suffocated the empire. What unspeakable transgression had brought about this existential despair? The fertile earth became dust, and the guiding stars vanished into an abyss of uncertainty. Hope flickered and died in the hearts of the people, for the signs were clear, the world was on the brink of absolute annihilation. Viracocha awakened.]
